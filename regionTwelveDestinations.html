            <p><b>Koronadal City</b>-The B'laan words koron, meaning cogon grass, and nadal, meaning plain, came together to form the name Koronadal. Marbel, a B'laan word meaning "waters murky," was the previous name of the area. When the City was inhabited by natives, these were the best names to describe the area.</p><p>
                Once, Koronadal's boundaries extended north to Polonoling, Tupi, south, and northeast to the Quezon mountain range and the municipality of T'boli, respectively. This area was once known as Koronadal.</p><p>
                The Koronadaleos' year begins with the Hinugyaw Festival, which commemorates the city's founding anniversary. 
                Koronadal City, one of the busiest in South Cotabato, has drawn a large number of visitors from around the country and the world thanks to a diverse calendar of events.
                To honor the city's founding, a riot of color and music is being held throughout the city. With their brightly colored costumes, the street dancing competition enlivens the streets of the cities and delays traffic for a few hours. </p><p>
                The street dancing in Hinugyaw is unique in that it takes place in the late afternoon, just before sunset, to avoid the oppressive heat. 
                Despite the fact that most of the participants are students, this initiative should be given the highest priority. Many people come out to watch the street dancing, which is one of the main attractions of the festival.
                Koronadal is the capital of South Cotabato, which is also known as the Land of the Dreamweavers because of its beautiful scenery. This is because this province is home to the majority of the T'Boli people. </p><p>
                So, if you're thinking of visiting Koronadal City soon, be prepared for a culturally rich and naturally breathtaking experience! Koronadal, like its neighbor Kidapawan City, is full of natural wonders like lakes, waterfalls, vast plantations, and many more!
