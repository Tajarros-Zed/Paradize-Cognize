            <p> <b>Bagasbas Beach</b> - If you are looking for a surfing spot in the Philippines, head over to Bagasbas Beach in Daet, Camarines Norte. It's a top
                destination for beginners and pro surfers because of its consistent waves the whole-year-round, making it the country's first surfing spot and
                the world's 61st. </p><p>The mile-long stretch of Bagasbas Beach features sandy bottom and shallow waters which make it safe for surfers. The beach

                government was able to maintain the cleanliness of the beach. Aside from surfing, you can enjoy here kiteboarding. This activity combines skills

            <p> <b>Paguriran Island</b> - A little gem of an island is tucked away in a quiet corner of Bacon, Sorsogon – the picturesque Paguriran Island. Paguriran is
                a tiny group of coral and rock islets located off the white sand beaches of Sawanga in Bacon. It is accessible from the adjacent beach by wading
                through crystal clear waters, the depth of which may range from ankle to waist depending on the tides. Within the island, coralline and granite
                crags enclose a shallow lagoon that is perfect for swimming (you have to watch out for sharp corals, though). You see, ‘Paguriran Island’ is
                really not an island but are assortment of craggy rocks that is shaped like a crater of a volcano. This wonderful formation nestles a lagoon within
                the sea wherein you can swim around clear aquamarine waters. If you are brave enough and have sturdy hiking sandals with you, trek your way
                up this islet and you’ll sure be rewarded with an amazing aerial view of Paguriran and the shoreline of Bacon.</p><p>
                There were a large number of kids frolicking around and enjoying this summer treat and this is not a surprise because this is their last weekend
                off before school starts again. We decided to do the same but as both my sister and I are not swimmers, we stayed at the middle area where
                the water was still chest deep. The rocks are very sharp and are also not sturdy enough to balance yourself with. Aside from swimming, you can
                also enjoy other activities here such as renting a boat and exploring the beaches of Bacon, there is also a marine sanctuary where you could
                bond with the pawikans (giant see turtles) or just chillax with the locals and belt out your favorite videoke tunes.</p><p>
                Coral hillocks rising from the ocean circle the blue lagoon of Paguriran.The lagoon may be reached via a sandbar at low tide, but even at high
                tide it may still be approached by foot, if one is so determined, and cross the waist-deep water. The rocks, mostly covered in vegetation that
                sometimes casts an emerald hue to the otherwise aquamarine blue of the lagoon, act as promontories from which the intrepid plunge, or else
                espy Captain Hook’s ship one half-expects will sail by.</p><p>
                The spot is so uncannily storybook-pretty, one would be led to believe mermaids visit it on moonlit nights to frolic in its warm waters. As our
                company of besotted adventurers rushingly did, to a man. The experience was so voluptuously lush that only after the fourth hour did, we
                muster the will to leave the water and head reluctantly back to shore

            <p><b>Subic and Tikling Beach</b> – The perfect place to have an exciting yet relaxing vacation is the shores of some of the best creations of nature that
                is the beaches. For me, Islands with beautiful beaches draw a sense of joy and divine feeling and it gives me the best for of relaxation. One of
                the beaches that provides magnificent view of tides hitting the shores with lush vegetation and deserves to be called a tropical paradise is
                located near Matnog Town in Sorsogon. The island having mesmerizing pristine beaches is known as Tikling Island which may not be as popular
                as Boracay or Bohol but is equally beautiful.</p><p>
                In just half an hour one can reach the Tikling Island from the shores of Matnog on a boat. Matnog, along scenic Matnog Bay, is located at the
                southernmost tip of Luzon. From the port of Matnog, Tikling Island can be spotted and as the boat sails nearer to the island one can catch the
                glimpse of the blue waves leading to the shores of fine white sands laid in front of the stretched green trees. However, once the boat reaches
                the shores it is very surprising to discover that these finest sandy beach does not have any ordinary white sand like any other beach instead the
                sands gloom with light pink color due to the scattering of the tiniest pink corals on the entire shore.
