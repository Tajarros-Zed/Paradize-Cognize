            <p><b>Alona Beach</b> - Situated in Panglao Island is a narrow strip of white sand beach that is can be considered as one of the best diving destinations
                in the world, the Alona Beach. It earned its fame for snorkeling and diving because it is located near a house reef, where corals and colorful
                fishes can be seen without the need for any equipment.</p><p>
                Its shore stretches 1.5 kilometers long and is walkable from end to end in 10-15 minutes. Amusingly, its name is derived from a local actress
                named Alona Alegre, who shot a film at the beach during the 70s when the beach was still vacant and was so beloved by the locals for her
                politeness that they named the beach after her.</p>
                <p><b>How to get there</b></p>
                Travelers can get to Alona Beach from Bohol's capital city, Tagbilaran, which is about 22 KM away. From the city, you can take a car and cross
                either the Dauis Bridge or Borja Bridge to get to Panglao Island. The beach sits in the southwest part of the island. Meanwhile, guests who
                arrive at the Panglao International Airport can also take a car or tricycle directly to the beach, which is only around 3 KM away.
                Otherwise, you can join tour packages that include Alona Beach in its itinerary for a more convenient trip.
                <p><b>Best time to visit</b></p>
                Travelers can visit Alona Beach all year round. The best time to visit is around November to April when the weather in the Philippines is cooler.
                There are also fewer chances of rain during these months, so you can make the most of your trip to this pristine beach.

            <p><b>Yapak Beach (Puka Shell Beach)</b> - Puka Beach, also known as Yapak Beach, is less touristy and has a peaceful seaside atmosphere. It was once
                famous for its shiny puka shells, beautiful little shells that can be picked up on the beach after the tide goes out. </p><p>Singer Liang Jingru's wedding
                photos were taken here, and now couples propose marriage here from time to time. Due to its remote location, access to Puka Beach is also
                inconvenient, but it also creates a beautiful, quiet and private environment. </p><p>When you climb over the hills and come here, you can stretch your
                body and mind and walk with the sea breeze, as if the entire coastline belongs to you, which is extraordinarily wonderful. However, the sand at
                Puka Beach is rougher than the powdery fine sand of White Beach, and the slope here is not very gentle.</p><p> Shells at Puka Beach were a popular
                accessory material in the 1970s and 1980s, but not every season is now available. During the typhoon season, the sand from the sea will flow
                back to the beach, covering the scattered shells. </p><p>Come here in the evening, quietly looking for shells and watching the sunset, also don't have a
                lot of fun. It doesn't matter if you can't pick up a shell, there are small vendors selling shell products on the beach, and there are small bracelets
                and other accessories made by local residents that can be purchased. <br>
