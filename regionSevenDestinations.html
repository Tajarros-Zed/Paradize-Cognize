            <p><b>Virgin Island</b> - It is no debate that Bantayan Island is a world-renowned beach destination in Cebu. It has one of the most amazing pristine
                white sand beaches in the Philippines with so many beautiful attractions you can tour around the island. And there is this little island nearby
                that became very popular because of “word of mouth”.</p><p>
                A 30-minute boat ride from Bantayan Island, Virgin Island is one of the main attractions in Bantayan Island that has an untouched white beach
                and crystal-clear waters where snorkeling can be enjoyed.</p><p>
                Though more expensive than usual and may not be ideal for budget-conscious travelers (see rates below), Virgin Island is private and
                maintained in good conditions. It is perfect for tourists who really have the heart for beaches and those who want to just chill and relax. The
                island also has cottages that you can rent price would depend on the type of cottage you would like to rent. There are hammocks which are
                free. And there is a local restaurant bar so you can have a meal or a drink.

            <p><b>White Beach Moalboal</b> - White Beach Moalboal, also known as Basdaku Beach, is the most popular beach in the busy tourist town of
                Moalboal, and one of the nicest South Cebu beaches. The first thing you need to understand about the Philippines is that any white sandy
                beach is going to attract a lot of locals, so this is as much a local spot as it is a tourist attraction.</p><p>
                Tourists often stay in Moalboal when they come to explore the South Cebu tourist spots, like Kawasan Falls or the Oslob Whale Sharks, so
                White Beach Moalboal can get a little crowded. Despite the throngs of tourists, it’s still a beautiful stretch of sand with enough space to spread
                out and secure your little spot for sunset. A relaxing afternoon at White Beach is the perfect end to a busy day exploring the many things to do
                in South Cebu!

            <p><b>Lambug Beach</b> - Lambug Beach, Badian is one of Cebu’s secret beaches, and a perfect day trip from Moalboal.
                Located around 20 minutes south of Moalboal in Badian, this area is also home to the famous Kawasan Falls. Lambug Beach is a perfect place to
                relax after you’ve been canyoneering, or if you have spent a few hours chasing waterfalls.</p><p>
                A beautiful stretch of white sand, Lambug Beach has that quintessential Philippine vibe with coconut palm trees leaning towards the crystal-
                clear aquamarine ocean. It isn’t very well known outside of the local community, so you could be the only tourists here. It’s paradise away from the crowds.
                In a series of articles showing day trips from Moalboal, if topping up your tan on a white sand beach in the Philippines is on your bucket list,
                Moalboal Eco Lodge share all you need to know about Lambug Beach, Badian.</p><p>
                From Moalboal, Lambug Beach is located in Badian, about 20 minutes away from our Eco Lodge (directions at the bottom of this post). After
                taking a right turn off the main highway, we drove along a road which provided beautiful views of the mountain range, hills and valleys.
                After parking our scooter, walking down the road we saw a large arc of white sand. With hardly any visitors, this was paradise compared to
                Basdaku White Beach in Moalboal, which is the most popular beach in this area, especially on a weekend. We were surprised how few people
                there were on this beach, especially because it’s budget friendly, has soft white sand, and is easy to reach from the city. It’s referred to by locals
                as “Cebu's Little Boracay”, but as we haven’t been to Boracay I cannot verify this high accolade. The long stretch of white sand was soft, and
                considering it’s a public beach it was well maintained. We passed a few make-shift beach stalls selling refreshments, but generally there was
                nothing else here. No restaurants, no hawkers, no hassle, just sand, sea and sunshine (apart from when it’s a cloudy day of course). As with
                anywhere in the Philippines, we encountered some friendly dogs playing and sleeping on the sand. Having only ever visited at high tide, I
                cannot say what this beach is like at low tide, but I have heard there are some rocks. There are a few huts you can rent if you want shade but I
                personally feel they are overpriced, therefore if you want to enjoy the beach but be out of the sun, bring a small tent or umbrella.
                <p>The row of pretty coloured fishing boats is a reminder of how the locals live.</p>

                <p>There are a few stalls selling snacks and drinks at Lambug Beach</p>
                <p>As with everywhere in the Philippines, you will encounter friendly dogs at Lambug</p>
                Lambug Beach is a favourite amongst the ex-pat Moalboal community, and it’s easy to see why! A true hidden gem, and a slice of paradise in
                Cebu.

        <div class="aboutVisayasBeach">
            <p><b>Pescador Island</b> - The Pescador Island is an island off the coast of Moalboal in Southern Cebu. It is famous for the rich marine ecosystem that
                makes it an ideal spot for diving and snorkeling.</p><p>
                The name of the island was derived from the Spanish word "pescador" which translates to "fisherman". It was primarily inspired by the way
                fishermen catch an enormous number of fishes around the area during the Spanish colonial heritage.
                The island only measures 50 meters in diameter but is 300 meters deep. Unlike other islands in Cebu, Pescador Island has no white sand beach,
                but it features coral rocks that almost cover the entirety of the place.</p><p>
                Pescador Island also doubles as a marine park where waters are abundant in aquatic animals. The island has numerous dive sites with various
                levels of water, ranging from shallow and deep levels. In the northeast side of the island, there are large sharp rocks, and pieces of corals from
                ages ago.</p><p>
                <b>Diving and Snorkelling in Pescador Island</b></p><p>
                Snorkeling in the island features a wide variety of fishes, colorful Acropora, and hard stony corals that are just 10 to 15 feet underwater, while
                the scuba diving highlights two dives: the Northeast side and the Southwest side.</p><p>
                The Northeast side of the island is where coral heads and large rocks break the surface. There is a large slope in the reef plateau, inclined to
                about 8 to 10 meters before dropping vertically into the abyss. The upper 15 meters is where marine life is present. Most fishes abundant here
                are large groups of soft corals, stonefish, and white frogfish. There are also a variety of sea turtles located in the area.</p><p>
                The Southwest of Pescador Island is most popularly known as ‘The Cathedral’ dive site. Aside from the teeming marine life, there is also a cave
                with a vertical swim where one can easily see the surface, thus the name of the site. Its entrance is located down at 28 meters, while the
                chimney is at 16 meters depending on the tides.
